Most people might find the story behind this project a bit absurd, but I think it is a good topic to write about so you can learn from my mistakes, understand how I've grown as a developer over the last four and half years, and get an brief glimpse into the way I attack problems and projects as a solo/freelance full-stack developer. 

## Creating a Portfolio Site Should Be Easy - Right?

Now, I don't think I am the only person who struggles with perfectionism and finding the best portfolio design ever. I won't deny that the standards I have established for my personal website/portfolio site may be unreasonable, nor will I deny the fact that I spend way too much time worrying about creating the "perfect portfolio website". It can be good to have high standards - especially when you are looking for a full-time job like I am right now, but there is a fine line between having high standards and not having an adequate solution at all.

I can honestly (and confidently) say that my portfolio website hasn't lived up to my standards for reasons not related to my skills, knowledge, or experience - the many projects I've created or contributed to can speak for that statement. The problem lies in the expectations for myself as a developer, a tough job market, lack of time and resources to spend on developing my ideal solution, and also wanting a site that is different from everybody else. Forget the cookie cutter portfolio website, I want the most unique and creative solution out there!

However, having the most unique and awesome portfolio website isn't always possible, nor is it always practical. I have tried to go so far outside of the box that I usually end up frustrated and not following through on ideas. I've tried combining my digital garden with my portfolio site and found out that they work better as separate projects. Here are a few other ideas and strategies I've used to try and create the perfect portfolio:

- Using nearly every different kind of framework, static site generator, or other technology to see if there is just a perfect stack for this project.
- Using UI Libraries or portfolio templates to get a head start on the project.
- Using a placeholder site while I spend a lot time working on the perfect site.

These are all things that could work, but in my case they didn't solve my problem. Different frameworks and SSGs ignore the main problem - a unique design or concept that differentiates my site. You kind of run into the same problem with UI libraries and portfolio templates since there could be a hundred other developers using that very exact same code as you that very moment you decide to use it - even worse, you can't claim credit for creating the site from scratch yourself. A placeholder site just makes it easier to procrastinate ever following through on creating a site and I've found it even becomes really hard to update your site and add content when it doesn't feel like "your personal site with your own personal touch". 

Struggling with a portfolio website doesn't necessarily make one a bad developer/designer, but it does expose some weaknesses that may be noticed by potential employers if you don't figure out how to solve this problem. The great thing about a weakness is that it is an incredible opportunity for growth and that is exactly what I have used this situation for: growth and becoming a better problem solver and developer.

## You Can't Just Not Have a Unique Personal Site - So the Problem Grows

The problem starts out as this silly brain-fart thing where you feel like you just don't know what design represents your personality the best or what you can do to make your portfolio website stand out from other developers. Over time, it turns into a bunch of abandoned GitHub repositories and occupied storage space on your hardrive from `git clone`-ing all the "failed attempt repositories". That develops into this barrier that feels like you are slowly degenerating back into the shitty coder who had to watch exactly how to do something in a tutorial five times before actually writing code for a project.

I've found myself chilling in tutorial hell with all the other stuck developers. I don't even want to know the amount of hours I've wasted looking at templates, source code, and documentation of some "magical tool" that will solve my portfolio problem without having to strain my brain at all for a minute. Tears have been shed as I worry that I can't actually design and create a portfolio website and now may not be able to code any project ever again because I suck so much... not true at all, but these are all the damn shitty experiences I've faced at one point or another. Sometimes I've experienced all of these situations multiple times to the point where I've felt like giving up entirely because who would want to hire a developer who can't even make a cool portfolio website?

Stupid f***ing portfolio sites would be the death of me, I swear. This fear would become a reality if I just gave up though, so I am grateful that I am both extremely driven, curious, and passionate for programming and that I am very stubborn and really don't ever give up on anything. I may not have had the best portfolio website at all times, but I have a GitHub profile that is connected to a lot of projects that I've created and contributed to. I've found it is always helpful to hang your head on the positives whenever you can - it's the only way you can be happy and move forward in life.

## Previous Portfolio Sites and My Latest Approach

So I have always had a website that showcases my projects and work to an extend, which is a good thing I suppose. Now I will say that not being confident in my portfolio site has made it more difficult to find full-time work, but I have a good freelance agency site for my business [Tar Heel Dev Studio](https://tarheeldevstudio.com), which has allowed me to find work and be a full-stack developer for the last four years. So there's proof I can do it - I just have to find an adequate solution I can feel good about. 

This portfolio site is actually very much based on my original portfolio website I created, but it features much better code and showcases my current skills. I was so proud of that design and of myself for putting all that effort I did into creating it - the main problem was that it was basically just HTML and CSS - hahahaha... 

Anyways, I would like to walk thorugh my previous versions of temporary portfolio solutions so we can see the progression of [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev) all the way from version one up until the website you are browsing right this very second.

## Previous Versions of GeauxWeisbeck4.dev

The design for this version of my personal website is very similar to [Version One](https://andrewsfirstportfolio.netlify.app/) which was very crude as it was one of the first sites I ever made. At the time I was quite proud of my personal portfolio website, and to be honest, the design was pretty cool and the CSS I wrote was pretty solid. Now, I won't brag about that project because it was pretty much just HTML pages and a CSS file that served as my first portfolio, but since I was struggling with deciding on a design I wanted for this project, I figured I might go back and try this layout once again.

The [second version I created](https://geauxweisbeck4.netlify.app) was a bit better, but still didn't really use a whole lot of programming in Typescript/JavaScript like I had intended to and so that became has-been portfolio site. While I worked on a few versions that you can see below, I spent a lot of itme continuing to learn and get better at programming, so I have plenty of projects to share on my portfolio website. I won't go into every detail of everything, but I will list projects I think really showcase my skills here and talk about other projects in this blog.

Here are some other versions I created or used as a placeholder until this site was created:

## Solving the Problem - Recycle, Refine, and Repurpose

So my original portfolio design has come full circle into what you are looking at today like I said. The cool part of this whole saga is that you can actually see how far I've come since that time four years ago when I felt like I would never become the developer I am today. There are so many little things that I've picked up and used to enhance the design and user experience for this project, making it feel like I righted the wrongs from the first time around.

In the end, I am actually very satisfied with the results of the first deployment of this new version of my portfolio website. The ironic thing is that this whole time I was looking for some new design that would get me that full-time job, showcase my skills and projects, and make people think I'm awesome. But in the end, my original design was actually the perfect solution for my personal portfolio website - I just needed to improve my knowledge and skills so I could make the perfect design into the perfect web app that will be a great project to showcase to potenetial employers and clients.

The lesson learned here today is never give up, always keep learning, and be proud of what you've created. You never know what project will be the one that you need to get a job or help you achieve something!
