              <h4>Product Positioning Sprint</h4>
              <h3>Project Website Made With Stackbit</h3>
              <p class="blackbox">I wasn't planning on attending this sprint until I got an email from Section 4 that
                  I was able to attend any sprint for the rest of the year - included with my membership which was already
                  a scholarship from my favorite company. Needless to say, this covered a difficult and abstract topic
                  that I think may have been one of the most important topics for me to end up exploring in business.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I thoroughly enjoyed this sprint for many reasons, but I had such a great time learning because of April
                  Dunford. She is a very intelligent, humorous, and thoughtful person, who made this topic easier for me
                  to understand. I strongly recommend anyone who needs help with product positioning to purchase and read
                  her book <i>Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It</i> -
                  I promise you will be entertained.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p class="blackbox">For my sprint project, I first considered Twilio, but I realized that they
                  really kind of had their positioning nailed down. I had recently found this company Stackbit and found
                  their product fascinating. I also saw that they were hiring, so I thought that this might be a good way to show
                  that I understand their product and also for me to apply these principles to a product that I believe coudl be
                  improved with the topics and frameworks used in this course.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Since Stackbit is a website creation platform and CMS, I thought it would be fun to use their product to present
                  my project. I got a stomach bug the last day this project was due and I didn't finish polishing off the presentation.
                  If there are some things that seem to be missing, I am literally adding them right now as I finish styling and
                  polishing off the website.
                  <br>

        <h4>MT Man Adventures</h4>
        <h3>Blog Website</h3>
        <p class="blackbox">
          This blog was created using the Jamstack framework with 11ty as my static website generator. To get started, I forked a repository from <a href="https://github.com/kevin-powell/JAMStack-blog-starter" alt="jamstack GitHub Kevin Powell">Kevin Powell</a> and edited the HTML and CSS before I set up the config files and all the routes for my website.
          <br>
          <br>
          The goal is to turn this project into a business. It also is serving as my Jamstack example for a March Madness series I am writing about on my newsletter, <a href="https://geauxweisbeck4.substack.com/" alt="meanstack developer newsletter">The MEANStack Developer Newsletter</a>. I intend to grow this business and sell general goods and merchandise.

        <h4>Damn Snake Game</h4>
        <h3>Made in Python</h3>
        <p class="blackbox">This is one of my favorite classic arcade games of all time. I had made this game before some years ago with HTML and JavaScript with a tutorial - oddly enough while I was first learning Python.
        This version was much easier to make. I was surprised there was no Pygame involved in creating this; the way the tutorial showed me to do this was with Turtle which was really fun.
        Credit to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu-963a584b/?originalSubdomain=uk">Dr. Angela Yu</a> for teaching me this in her 100 Days of Projects Python Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="blackbox">I have to figure out how to render the game on my site still, but in the meantime you can download the game from it's GitHub Repository <a href="https://github.com/GeauxWeisbeck4/damn-snake-game">here</a>.
        Once you are at the GitHub repository, go to the green Code button and click download zip file on the dropdown. Once you download the file, unzip the folder to wherever you can access it with your IDE.
        Open up you Python IDE and open the main.py folder in Damn Snake Game and "Run Module". Be ready because the game starts quick! Tell me what your high score is! Mine was 9.</p>

        <h4>Geaux Pomodoro Timer</h4>
        <h3>Improve Productivity and Workflow</h3>
        <p class="blackbox">
          The Pomodoro (Pomodoro means tomato in Italian) Timer is a neat productivity tool that helps you work in sessions with short breaks, and after a certain number of runs, gives you a longer break. This was created based on the Pomodoro Technique, which breaks work up into four 25 minute sessions. After each work session, you are given a short break of 5 minuts. After all four work sessions are complete, you get a longer break that ranges from 15 to thirty minutes.
          <br>
          The theory behind this management method is that it reduces the number of internal and external workflow interruptions and allows you to get more work done than you would working for 5 minutes, then checking Facebook - another 5 minutes and then checking Twitter... you get the idea. If your activity gets interrupted, the activity must be recorded and postponed or the timer must be abandoned completely for the session.
          <br>
          You can view my project on <a href="https://github.com/GeauxWeisbeck4/geauxpomodorotimer">GitHub</a> for now while I work on getting it published to the website.
